# learning_log
A journal for keeping track of topics you're learning about. 

I followed the tutorial from "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes--which I highly recommend for Python beginners.
I'm looking forward to adding more features to Learning Logs including more CSS styling, a weekly goals section and possibly a calendar to which a user could add events.
